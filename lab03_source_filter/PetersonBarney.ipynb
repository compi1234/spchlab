        "G. Peterson and H. Barney, \"Control methods used in a study of vowels,\" Journal of the Acoustical Society\n",
        "of America, vol. 24, pp. 175-184, 1952   .\n",
        "##### Purpose\n",
        "Especially Fig. 8 from this paper has become famous.\n",
        "In this notebook we try to recreate this plot, but also allow for slightly different implementation of statistics and visualization.\n",
        "\n",

        "##### Disclaimers  \n",
        "+  The original speech data was not preserved, but the formant measurements were.  This data has been reused in a number of publications.\n",
        "I cannot guarantee that the dataset that I got is 100% correct as I don't remember exactly how I got them; I believe indirectly via Tony Robinson  \n",
        "+  The average formant values obtained in this paper slightly deviate from the ones published in the 1952 paper, though the differences are barely significant. This is likely due to a slightly different frequency warping, numerical (rounding) errors, ...      \n",
        "+ This data is much cleaner and more consistent than the data later collected by Hillenbrand (1995).  So in a sense, this data looks too good to be true."
