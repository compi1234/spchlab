## Exercises

Within these exercises we make use of the "Generative, Bayesian" Framework in which the data is modeled  by a simple Gaussian  Distribution. 
The number of features is kept very small (1 to 3).
The different exercises all make use of the same paradigm and apply it to gradually more complex situations by increasing the dimensionality of the features and increasing the number of classes.

The work involves: data processing, data exploration, data modeling, building the classifier, testing the classifier.
