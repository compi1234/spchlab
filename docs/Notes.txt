- timit1 & timit3 can be further integrated
  a. feature extraction + GMM on mfcc13, mel24, mel80
  b. add delta's
  c. MLP

- links, figures, assets, ...
the only reliable linking to figures is by putting them in the docs/assets directory
and then in Markdown refer to them as
<div>
<img src="https://compi1234.github.io/spchlab/assets/tutorial_icon.jpg">
</div>
this works for most .jpg files, but not for all and in general not for .png files
-- can't figure this all out
