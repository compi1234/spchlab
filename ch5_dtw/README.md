## Exercises

The purpose of these exercises is to get hands on experience with the basic principles of dynamic time warping, a key concept in speech recognition and sequence recognition in general.

The exercises are very simple but do involve quite a few - extremely simple - computations.   
We strongly believe that doing these exercises BY HAND without any help from any computer implementations helps full understanding.

Afterwards we will provide you with Jupyter notebooks that can handle these and more complex problems.
