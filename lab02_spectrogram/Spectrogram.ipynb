    "## Spectrogram GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "**iSpectrogram** is a GUI that lets you visualize various spectral representations including Fourier Spectrum, Mel spectrum and cepstrum or mel-cepstrum.\n",
    "The parameters of the spectral analysis can be modified in an interactive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters to be passed when started the GUI\n",
    "The only parameters that you are likely to need are:\n",
    "- type (int)\n",
    "    + type=1:  standard spectrogram\n",
    "    + type=2:  spectrogram with a spectral slice plot in Right Hand figure; A frame slider controls its position\n",
    "- root (None or str, default(None) is equiv to \"pkg_resources_data\"):  root directory where the GUI will look for sampled data and segmentation files\n",
    "\n",
    "### GUI controls\n",
    "- frame shift (in msec): default=10.0\n",
    "- frame length (in msec): default=25.0\n",
    "- preemphasis: default=0.97 (range: 0.0 - 1.0)\n",
    "- mel spectrogram view: checkbox\n",
    "- cepstral view: checkbox  (if mel spectrogram box is checked, MFCCs are shown otherwise the cepstrum obtained from the Fourier Spectrum)\n",
    "- number of mel bands: default=80\n",
    "- number of cepstral coefficients: default=12\n",
    "- wavFile: name of waveform file (relative to root)\n",
    "- Range: start and endtime for waveform selection\n",
    "- segFile: name of segmentation file (relative to root)\n",
    "\n",
    "*KNOWN LIMITATIONS*:\n",
    "- The slider may for certain settings not perfectly align with the spectrogram\n",
    "- Interaction can be sluggish when \"sliding\" the slider, better is to \"click\" the intended location\n",
    "- When changing a text field: put your cursor at the end of the text and hit enter to signal your modification to the GUI !\n",
    "- The segmentation filename field is not cleared when updating the WavFile.  However, internally the segmenation information is cleared; so it will show bogus segmentation information in the GUI but not in the plot\n",

    "#### Audio Files\n",
    "Suggested Files to choose from:  ( included in the demo directory of pyspch ) :\n",

    "#### Segmentations\n",
    "For the example speech files a number of segmentations are available (not all for each example). They have the same name as the .wav files, but a different extension:\n",
    "\".gra\" for grapheme or letter ,\".phn\" for phone and \".wrd\" for word   "
